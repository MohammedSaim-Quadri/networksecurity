# Section 49 - End-to-End MLOps Project

## Overview
This is a comprehensive MLOps project that covers the entire machine learning lifecycle, from data collection and preprocessing to deploying a model and managing it in production. The goal of this project is to demonstrate setting up a robust MLOps pipeline that ensures seamless integration, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models.

## Project Stages

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gather and clean the dataset for training.
- Perform necessary transformations, including:
  - Handling missing values
  - Scaling numerical features
  - Encoding categorical variables
  
### 2. Model Development
- Develop and train a machine learning model using algorithms such as:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Deep Learning models (if applicable)
- Optimize the model through hyperparameter tuning.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Assess model performance using appropriate metrics, such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- Fine-tune the model based on evaluation results.

### 4. Model Deployment
- Deploy the trained model to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) to enable real-time or batch predictions.
- Utilize AWS S3 for storing:
  - Preprocessed data
  - Model weights
  - Other artifacts for future inference or retraining

### 5. MLOps: Model Monitoring and CI/CD
- Implement monitoring mechanisms to track model performance in production.
- Automate model deployment using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Ensure scalability and maintain model accuracy over time.

## Input and Output
### Input:
- The dataset used for training the machine learning model (e.g., customer data, sales data, etc.).

### Output:
- **Trained Model:** A deployable machine learning model.
- **Model Artifacts:** Saved preprocessed data, model weights, and hyperparameters stored in AWS S3.
- **Predictions:** The modelâ€™s inference results on unseen data.

## Goal of the Project
By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in:
- Setting up a scalable and automated MLOps pipeline.
- Handling real-world challenges in machine learning deployment.
- Leveraging cloud services for model storage and inference.
- Monitoring and maintaining model performance post-deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Scikit-learn
- **Cloud Services:** AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS ECR
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment Tools:** FastAPI, Docker
